## Installation

Require this package, with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), in the root directory of your project.

``` bash
$ composer require artisanry/settings
```

## Configuration

Laravel Settings supports optional configuration.

To get started, you'll need to publish all configurations:

```bash
$ php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Artisanry\Settings\SettingsServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

This will create a `config/settings.php` file in your app that you can modify to set your configuration. Also, make sure you check for changes to the original config file in this package between releases.

## Migration _(Only required if you use the database driver)_

To get started, you'll need to publish all migrations:

```bash
$ php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Artisanry\Settings\ServiceProvider" --tag="migrations"
```

And then run the migrations to setup the database table.

```bash
$ php artisan migrate
```

``` php
Setting::all();
```
